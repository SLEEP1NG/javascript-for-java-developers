# PRESENTATION: JavaScript for Java Developers (2018 Edition)

It's easy to forget that two of today's most popular programming languages -- Java and JavaScript -- were introduced to the world in 1995 in the most popular web browser -- Netscape Navigator. The two languages' virtual machines even share a common architect: Lars Bak was the technical lead on the Java HotSpot JVM before going on to develop the V8 JavaScript engine. V8 is now the core JavaScript engine inside Google Chrome, NodeJS, MongoDB, CouchDB, and many more.

In this talk, Scott Davis (Principal Engineer, ThoughtWorks) breaks through the muddied sibling rivalry of these two languages for a clear-eyed technical discussion of each. We'll discuss the languages, the platforms, and the fundamental, foundational differences between the two. The end goal is not to declare a "winner" in a non-existent competition, but rather to ensure that you, the developer, can be equally successful with both.
