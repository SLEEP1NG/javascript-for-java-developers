# PRESENTATION: JavaScript for Java Developers

Such similar names; such very, very different programming languages...

Both Java and JavaScript debuted on the same day -- May 23, 1995 -- at the dawn of the World Wide Web in this hot new browser called Netscape Navigator. Both embrace a platform-agnostic strategy of "Write Once, Run Anywhere", although they implement that strategy in very different ways. And both, despite sharing the same cradle at birth, seem to be more divisive than unifying.

In this talk, Scott Davis (author/presenter of the O'Reilly video series "Architecture of the MEAN Stack") leverages his 20 years of experience as a Java developer -- combined with his 20 years of experience as a JavaScript developer -- to help illuminate the similarities and differences between the two popular languages. Along the way, we'll also compare the platforms, the paradigms, the ideologies, and the ecosystems of these two incredibly popular technologies.
